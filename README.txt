Used MapReduce to complete the following tasks: 

A list of the guests who visited at least ten times (task1.py).
A list of the ten most frequently-visited staff members (task2.py).
A list of the guests who visited at least once in both 2009 and 2010 (task3.py).
A list of the people who were both guests and staff (in other words, someone whom is visited) in 2009 and / or 2010 (as long as someone visited at any point across the two years, and was visited at any point across the two years, they count, whether or not these two events occurred in the same year) (task4.py).

To run a particular task, if the downloaded White House data is in data.csv:

python3 taskx.py data.csv

Where x is the number of the task you want to run.
